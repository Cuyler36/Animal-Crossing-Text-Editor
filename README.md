# Animal-Crossing-Text-Editor
Currently in development. Saving is not completed, so I would recommend you just play around with it.
It can currently edit text from the following games:
* Doubutsu no Mori (N64)
* Doubutsu no Mori+ (GCN)
* Animal Crossing (GCN)
* Doubutsu no Mori e+ (GCN)

Wild World, City Folk, and New Leaf support may come at a later date.
